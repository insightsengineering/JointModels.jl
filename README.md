# Joint Models with Turing.jl in Julia

Experimental package for the purpose of building joint longitudinal and survival models in Turing.jl.

## ToDo

- copy tests from workflows; init tests
- Write a spesific joint model structs that can be used out of the box, should support multiple longitudinal processes.
- include workflows in documentation as examples how to use the package i.e. build joint models
- Review: plotting functionality for longitudinal models and survival models via simulation
- extend to Distributions.jl functionality
